# unit-4-game

<p>
  This is a web application game that gives the user a random number at the start of the game. 
  There are four crystals that the user has to click to figure out the amount of points each is worth.
  The goal is to reach the Goal Score without going over or under. Each time when the game starts, 
  the game will change the values of each crystal and the goal score.
